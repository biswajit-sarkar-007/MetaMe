# 🧠 Meta Me — Your Story, Animated.

> 🚀 A visually animated, scroll-triggered dev journey portfolio built for the [PortXFolio Hackathon](https://devpost.com/hackathons).

## 🧠 About the Project

**Meta Me** is designed for devs who want to go beyond boring resumes. It's an **animated scroll-based timeline** of your journey – from learning C++ in college to contributing to open source, and winning hackathons.

Think of it as:
- 🛤 A **"little coder’s quest"** – one scroll, one milestone.
- 🎥 Mini story moments – first PRs, side projects, your tech stack evolution.
- 🌈 Custom themed – Dark Mode, Hacker UI, and more.

This was built for the **PortXFolio Hackathon**:  
> “Show us the limitless creativity you can bring to your own portfolio!”
